## Successes & Challenges

### Regina

It's been a fun and informative journey, working on this project. I feel like I've learned so much! I think my favorite part is when I spend several days trying to learn a new concept, and then being able to successfully implement what I learned into the project. It definitely is a rewarding experience.

I think my major struggle is simply lack of experience. I'm very orderly when it comes to how I approach projects and the lack of experience can sometimes make me not take such orderly approaches. I know that this is just the reality of being a beginner, and I look forward to gaining experience with each project I do. 

I'm also learning a lot about the power of teamwork and how important and fruitful good communication can be. It's been a true pleasure working with Allison on this project!
